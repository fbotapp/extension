Privacy Policy - fbot CORS Proxy Extension
Last updated: March 6, 2025
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the fbot CORS Proxy Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "extension") handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.
Data Collection
We do not collect or store any personal data. The fbot CORS Proxy extension operates entirely locally on your device and does not transmit any data to our servers or third parties.
Local Storage
The extension uses local browser storage only to save your preferences (such as whether the extension is enabled or disabled). This data never leaves your device and is only used to provide the extension's functionality.
API Requests
The extension's primary function is to proxy API requests to bypass CORS restrictions. While the extension processes these requests, it does not log, collect, or store the content of your requests or responses.
Permissions
Our extension requires the following permissions:

declarativeNetRequest: To modify response headers to bypass CORS restrictions
storage: To save your extension preferences locally
webRequest: To intercept and modify web requests to bypass CORS restrictions
host permissions: To handle API requests to various domains

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of bypassing CORS restrictions during web development and not for collecting any user data.
Security
The extension is designed to be used in development environments only. We recommend disabling the extension when browsing sensitive websites as it modifies security-related headers that protect against cross-origin attacks.
Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing for the extension. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
